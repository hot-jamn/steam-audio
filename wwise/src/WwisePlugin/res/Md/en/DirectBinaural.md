## Direct Binaural

If **true**, uses HRTF-based binaural rendering. Results in improved localization, including vertical and front-back spatialization, at the cost of slightly increased CPU usage. Requires stereo headphones.

If **false**, uses constant-power panning. Can be used to render to any channel configuration.
