## Dipole Weight

Blends between monopole (omnidirectional) and dipole directivity patterns. 0 = pure monopole (sound is emitted in all directions with equal intensity), 1 = pure dipole (sound is focused to the front and back of the source). At 0.5, the source has a cardioid directivity, with most of the sound emitted to the front of the source. Only used if **Directivity** is set to **true**.
