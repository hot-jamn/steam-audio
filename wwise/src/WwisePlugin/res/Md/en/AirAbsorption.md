## Air Absorption

If **true**, a physics-based frequency-dependent air absorption model is applied to the sound. This is an exponential falloff, with higher frequencies falling off faster with distance than lower frequencies.

**NOTE**: If this is set to **true**, make sure to disable any distance-based low-pass or high-pass filter curves applied to the sound in the Positioning tab.
